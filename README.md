# Model Based Test Case Generation
In this project, I want to gather all state behaviours generated by TLA+ TLC model checker to generate test cases for my implementation. This implementation is based off the specification I wrote in TLA+

### File Info
`dotparser.py`: The main runner of this project. This file takes in the "dot" file generated by TLA+ toolbox. Run your specification with the following text in the toolbox `-dump dot,colorize,actionlabels Model_1` in the TLC Options tab -> "Parameter" options -> "TLC Command line parameters". And turn off "Visualize State Graph" option in TLC Options -> Features. Takes in the "dot" graph file and stores it into a data structure. Then we can generate paths for further testing. 

`tlaparser.py`: This is called by the `dotparser.py` and is used to parse the tla stuff inside the "dot" file. Uses the `python-lark` parsing library to parse TLA state information.

`grammars.lark`: The grammar required by the `python-lark` library to parse TLA+ states.

DOTFiles/ : Contains some TLA+ "dot" files for testing and usage.
